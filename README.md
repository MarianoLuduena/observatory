## Functional Programming in Scala Capstone

My honest attempt at the final project ([scala-capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-capstone/home/welcome)) of
the Scala specialization.

There's plenty of room for improvement, both code-wise and performance-wise (for instance, with the current
implementation, the stations file is processed multiple times -once per year-, which is wasteful). Nonetheless, the code
is good enough to pass the grader's tests (10/10).

Instructions for each milestone can be found inside the `milestones` directory. The CSV files that contain the data
related to weather stations and temperature metrics is not included due to their big size.
